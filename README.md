<h1>🔐 Professional Password Strength Checker</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Professional Password Strength Checker</strong>, a Python-based tool designed to help users create robust and secure passwords. This project was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.</p>

<h2>🛠️ Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Password Evaluation:</strong> The checker evaluates the password, ensuring it meets the necessary security criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> Criteria are automatically ticked off when they are fulfilled, giving users immediate feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Password Visibility Toggle:</strong> An eye icon allows you to show or hide your password for ease of use.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Focused:</strong> The tool is designed with user privacy in mind, ensuring that passwords are not stored or transmitted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💻 How to Use</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/zoecyber001/PRODIGY_CS_03</code></li>
    <li>Navigate to the project directory: <code>cd Password_Checker</code></li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies: <code>pip install tkinter</code></li>
    <li>Run the application: <code>python password_checker.py</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Upon running the application, a graphical user interface (GUI) will appear where you can type in a password and watch as the criteria are automatically checked off in real-time. The strength of your password will be displayed based on the fulfillment of security requirements.</p>
